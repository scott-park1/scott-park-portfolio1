Project Description:
Our final project is an interactive web application that helps users manage their time effectively by setting personalised work and break sessions. To make the experience enjoyable and creative, we've included animated character and environment sprites.

Technologies used:
The project was built using React, TypeScript, CSS, and leverages SQLite, Knex, Vite, Superagent, and Express for data storage, server-side operations, and API handling.

Challenges:
Implementing smooth toggle button features and designing a flexible page layout.

Improvements:
Future improvements include adding responsiveness for various screen sizes and expanding the library of animated character and environment sprites to offer more customisation options for users.
