Project Description:
In the Foundations phase of my web development journey, I created my first blog that includes the challenges and sprints we worked on.

Technologies used:
The project utilised HTML and CSS for the blog's structure and styling.

Challenges:
A notable challenge was adding a top navigation bar for seamless navigation.

Improvements:
I plan to enhance the page with different styles, including a menu icon in the navigation bar, to elevate its visual appeal.
